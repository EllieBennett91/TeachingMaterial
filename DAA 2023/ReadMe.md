# DAA 2023

## Overview
This was the second [Digital Applications in Assyriology (DAA) Nordic Summer School, held at the University of Helsinki](https://www.helsinki.fi/en/researchgroups/ancient-near-eastern-empires/studying/14-18-august-2023-digital-applications-in-assyriology-nordic-summer-school). 

I taught alongside Saana Sv√§rd, [Lena Tambs](https://github.com/ltambs), [Aleksi Sahala](https://github.com/asahala), [Rune Rattenborg](https://github.com/runeisforr), and [Seraina Nett](https://github.com/serainan). Together we gave a comprehensive overview of some of the digital tools available to Assyriological researchers. We covered principles of data management and cleaning, an introduction to Python, principles and examples of data visualisations, and an introduction to network analysis (NA).

I taught two aspects during DAA 2023: Python and lexical networks. For Python the goal was to get the students comfortable with coding by taking them through a process they had already been guided through the day before: cleaning a .csv file. Then we explored the dataset by retrieving some basic statistics of the .txt file. The related files are:
* '1. cleaning df.py'
* '2. exploring texts.py'
* '4. dictionary.py'
* 'Introduction to Python.pdf'
* 'SAA1_Nimrud_lemma.txt'
* 'SAA1_python_example.csv'
* 'DAA 2023 group qs.pdf'

For the lexical networks, I gave an introduction to the [Lexical Networks](https://www.helsinki.fi/en/researchgroups/ancient-near-eastern-empires/research-data/anee-lexical-networks-v20) made by the [Center of Excellence Ancient Near Eastern Empires (ANEE)](https://www.helsinki.fi/en/researchgroups/ancient-near-eastern-empires) I introduced the basic principles of word co-occurrence networks, what the data the networks were built on looks like, and how they can use the lexical networks. The related files are:
* 'Lexical Portal.pdf'

## Contents of the folder
### 1. cleaning df.py
This file contains small scripts that are all commented out. The lines are designed so that in class we can go through line by line, explain what the script does, and the students can run the script and immediately see what it does to the .csv file.

The script should give the students basic code to clean their own data automatically, resulting in a .txt file.

### 2. exploring texts.py
This file contains small scripts that are all commented out. The lines are designed so that in class we can go through line by line, explain what the script does, and the students can run the script and immediately see results of queries made of their .txt file.

The script should give the students basic code to begin exploring their own datasets, and answer some small research questions.

### 4. dictionary example.py
Not covered in class, but provided here in case students in the future would like an example of a Python dictionary. I used this dictionary to clean the entries relating to the senders and receivers of letters in the SAA 1 corpus used in class.

### Introduction to Python.pdf
Slides used in class to introduce students to Python and why it could be useful in humanities research.

### DAA 2023 group qs.pdf
After going through the scripts, the students were divided up into small groups. They were asked to try to answer at least one question on this sheet. The questions were designed to make the students try to break down a research question into stages the scripts they were given could answer.

### Lexical Portal.pdf
Slides used in class to introduce students to the [Lexical Networks](https://www.helsinki.fi/en/researchgroups/ancient-near-eastern-empires/research-data/anee-lexical-networks-v20) built by ANEE.
